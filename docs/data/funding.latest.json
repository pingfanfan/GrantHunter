I hold an MPH degree in epidemiology from the University of Texas at Houston in the US, where I pursued graduate research training in genomics at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. I received a PhD in genetic epidemiology from the University of Cambridge in the UK in 2017, as a Gates Cambridge Scholar and as the first Homerton College Junior Research Fellow in Clinical Medicine. I was subsequently awarded a Future Leaders Fellowship by UK Research and Innovation in 2020, enabling me to establish a research group at the University of Bristol that uses inherited genetic variation to investigate the causes and correlates of tumour genomic features with the aim of informing the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of common cancers.

I rendered my thoughts in the form of colored bricks, building until my fingertips hurt from pushing pieces together. This passion for building translated into a love for science, which resulted in a Bachelor’s degree in Optical Engineering at the University of Rochester. During my studies I explored the ray, wave, and quantum natures of light and I fell in love with its inherent duality. There’s no absolute definition to light’s character, it depends on the context in which it interacts with its surroundings. Science and technology inspire me, and management and entrepreneurship are my driving passions. I truly enjoy working with people, especially to push forward new technologies to improve our society’s living standards. At Cambridge I will work with Professor Clemens Kaminski’s group to pioneer new trade-offs between optical and digital complexity in super resolution microscopy to better understand chemical reactions in the human "

Departmental nomination Gates Cambridge asks academic departments in Cambridge to nominate a small number of eligible applicants who meet all four of the scholarship&#8217;s criteria to a very high level. This ensures that those nominated by departments are academically outstanding and are likely to succeed as a postgraduate student at Cambridge and also that they show evidence of meeting Gates Cambridge&#8217;s selection criteria. A relatively small number of those who apply for a Gates Cambridge Scholarship are nominated by departments and then invited to interview. 2. Interview All candidates nominated by academic departments are invited to a short interview to assess how they meet all four Gates Cambridge criteria. Scholars are then selected after interview. If you are called to interview You will be sent full details about the format and arrangements on the timing set out on our Timeline page. If you are invited for in"
